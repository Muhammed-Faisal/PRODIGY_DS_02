# PRODIGY_DS_02 - Used Car Price Analysis

This repository contains my submission for Task-02 of the Data Science Internship at **Prodigy InfoTech**.

## Task Description

**Task:** Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice.  
I chose a **Used Car Prices** dataset containing features like brand, year, mileage, fuel type, and price.

## Dataset Features

- `Name`
- `Location`
- `Year`
- `Kilometers_Driven`
- `Fuel_Type`
- `Transmission`
- `Owner_Type`
- `Mileage`, `Engine`, `Power`
- `Seats`, `New_Price`, `Price`

## Key Steps

1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Dropped irrelevant columns
   - Parsed numeric values from strings (e.g., "19.7 kmpl")
   - Filled or removed missing values in key columns

2. **EDA:**
   - Count plots for fuel type, transmission, and owner type
   - Scatter plots and bar plots for price vs features
   - Correlation heatmap to identify strong predictors

3. **Insights:**
   - Power and car age are strong price indicators
   - Diesel and petrol cars dominate the market
   - Automatic cars tend to cost more, but are less frequent

## Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## Outcome

Gained valuable experience in cleaning real-world data, handling missing and unstructured values, and performing insightful EDA.
